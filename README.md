# Data-Augmentation
How Data Augmentation Affects Deep Learning Performance

This tutorial will explore the impacts of data augmentation in relation to image classification. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset and analysing how it compares to a baseline model and a model which uses an augmented dataset. Augmentation techniques such as flipping, jittering and rotating will be investigated, showing how they can be performed and what effects they have on an image. Readers should already have a basic understanding of CNNs. After completing the tutorial, they should gain a deeper understanding of data augmentation, its applications, and its impact on deep learning models.
